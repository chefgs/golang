# CONTRIBUTORS Guide

## How to get started?

The easiest way to start is to look at existing issues and see if there’s something there that you’d like to work on. You can filter issues with the label “[Good first issue](https://github.com/chefgs/golang/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)” which are relatively self sufficient issues and great for first time contributors.

Once you decide on an issue, please comment on it so that all of us know that you’re on it.

If you’re looking to add a new feature, [raise a new issue](https://github.com/chefgs/golang/issues/new) and start a discussion with the community. Engage with the maintainers of the project and work your way through.

You'll need to perform the following tasks in order to submit your changes:

- Fork the `golang` repository or Create a branch for your changes. 
- Add commits to the `fork` or `branch`
- Open a [PR](https://github.com/chefgs/golang/compare) and choose your `branch_name` or `fork_name` to share your contribution.
